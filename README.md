# Basic RISC-V emulator



An **early and basic implementation** of a RISC-V CPU emulator that allows the execution of simple assembly instructions directly or via hexadecimal encoding. The project is still in very early development and currently supports a *few* arithmetic and shift operations.


## Compile instruction
```
javac core/cpu/CpuCore.java core/commands/*.java core/*.java
```

## Run
```
java core.RiscJive
```

## To-Do
- Implement remaining instructions
- Be able to convert hex codes to assembly and back
- Allow execution of assembly rather than just hex codes
- Create stack memory
- Basic debugger
